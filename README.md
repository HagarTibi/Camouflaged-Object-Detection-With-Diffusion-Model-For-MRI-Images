# Camouflaged Object Detection With Diffusion Model For MRI Images
This paper explores the adaptation of the DiffCOD (Diffusion Camouflaged Object Detection) model for tumor detection in brain MRI images. The framework leverages diffusion models to identify tumor regions by utilizing their capability to reverse noise effects and extract meaningful features from noisy or degraded inputs. During training, the model learns to recognize and localize tumors by analyzing patterns of degradation and noise in MRI images, while the inference process refines noisy inputs into diagnostic-quality outputs highlighting tumor regions. The framework incorporates an Injection Attention Module (IAM) to integrate conditional semantic features that enhance tumor detection and a Feature Fusion (FF) module to combine multi-scale features, ensuring critical diagnostic details are preserved. This approach is particularly relevant for medical imaging, where accurate tumor detection is vital for effective diagnosis and treatment planning, and demonstrates the potential of diffusion-based frameworks in advancing healthcare technologies.
