# Diffusion Camouflaged Object Detection (diffCOD) Model for Image Restoration

This repository contains the implementation of a novel approach to image restoration using the Diffusion Camouflaged Object Detection (diffCOD) model. The diffCOD model leverages diffusion models to address the challenge of restoring degraded images by treating it as a process of reversing noise effects.

## Overview

The framework utilizes a diffusion-based approach, where the image restoration process is formulated as reversing the noise added to ground-truth images. Through training, the model learns to handle various types of noise and degradation levels, enabling it to refine noisy inputs into high-quality restored images during inference.

### Key Components

- **Injection Attention Module (IAM):** This module supports the denoising process by incorporating conditional semantic features, which improves the model's ability to reverse noise effects effectively.
- **Feature Fusion (FF) Module:** The FF module combines multi-scale features to maintain and enhance image details, resulting in better noise removal and image quality.

## Applications

This approach is particularly relevant in fields where high-quality image restoration is critical, such as:

- **Medical Imaging:** Enhances image quality for accurate diagnosis and analysis.
- **Remote Sensing:** Improves the clarity of satellite and aerial images for better environmental monitoring.
- **Photography:** Restores degraded images to their original quality, preserving details and reducing noise.

## Objective

The primary aim of this framework is to enhance noise removal and improve image quality during the restoration process, offering a powerful tool for applications that require precise and high-fidelity image reconstruction.
