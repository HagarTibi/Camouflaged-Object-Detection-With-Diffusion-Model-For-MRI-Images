# Image Restoration with Diffusion Model
This paper presents a novel approach to image restoration task using the diffCOD (Diffusion Camouflaged Object Detection) model. The framework utilizes diffusion models to address the challenge of restoring degraded images by treating it as a process of reversing noise effects. Through training, the model learns to manage types of noise and degradation levels by reversing the noise added to ground-truth images. During inference, the model refines noisy inputs into restored images. The framework includes an Injection Attention Module (IAM) to support the denoising process by incorporating conditional semantic features, and a Feature Fusion (FF) module to combine multi-scale features, helping to maintain and improve image details. This approach aims to enhance noise removal and image quality in the restoration process. This approach is particularly relevant in fields such as medical imaging, remote sensing, and photography, where high-quality image restoration is critical for accurate analysis and visualization.
